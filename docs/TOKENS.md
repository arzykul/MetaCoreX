ARZY-G â€” Token Born from Usefulness

Token Type: ERC20 (Upgradeable)
Symbol: ARZY-G
Total Supply: Dynamic (minted only via verified usefulness)

ðŸŽ¯ Minting Rule

ARZY-G can only be minted when:

A task is completed

An AI Core verifies its usefulness

A mintByUsefulness() function is called


function mintByUsefulness(address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata proof) external onlyAI {}

ðŸ”¥ Reserve Logic

Employers lock tokens in ARZY-Reserve

Workers complete useful work

Token-child is minted to worker

Reserve parent token is burned (or returned depending on DAO setting)


ðŸ§  Why It Matters

No mining, no farming, no airdrops

Token = Proof of Usefulness

Stops speculation, enforces purpose
