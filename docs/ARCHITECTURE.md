MetaCoreX System Architecture

MetaCoreX is built on five modular cores that interact as a unified digital infrastructure:

1. ðŸ¤– AI Core

Task validation and usefulness scoring

AI agent verification of labor

Prevents minting without meaningful input



2. ðŸ’³ Transactional Core

Responsible for minting ARZY-G tokens

Operates on the principle of usefulness ledger

Secure mint/burn functions with traceability



3. ðŸ—³ DAO Core

Manages consensus, reserves, upgrades

Supports DAO-based proposals and governance



4. ðŸ–¥ Visual Core

Interface for agents, users, and governance

Includes dashboards and SDKs for integration



5. ðŸ“¡ Event Bus

Asynchronous message layer

Powers modular communications between cores




Each core is independent but communicates over the Event Bus, ensuring full modularity and resilience.
